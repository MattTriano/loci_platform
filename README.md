# Loci

This is a sandbox for experimenting with and evaluating different architectural data platform components/designs, ideally in search of the *critical locus* (a set of optimal constraint-satisfying points).

As this is intended as a sandbox environment, it will be inconsistent in the production-readiness of implementations and shouldn't be considered for production usage.
